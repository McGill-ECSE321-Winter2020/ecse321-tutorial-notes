==== Steps to complete

The description of the next steps is intentionally high-level and sketchy to force you 
to face and solve several emerging problems.

You need to provide the following functionality by extending the Vue.js component:

1. **List all events (name, date, startTime, endTime)**
** Introduce an array **events** in the frontend data store
** Call the appropriate backend service to fill the contents
** Provide a dynamic list in the component and bind it to **events**

1. **Create a new event (name, date, startTime, endTime)**
** Introduce an object **newEvent** in the frontend data store with four properties
(e.g. name, date, startTime, endTime).
*** Set the initial values of these properties to something
** Provide a button to initiate creating a new event
** Provide HTML input fields to set event details
** Create a call to the appropriate backend service, i.e. **createEvent()**
** Introduce an object **errorEvent** for error message related to event creation
** Provide corresponding HTML field for displaying the error message (e.g. `<span>`), and set
its appearance condition to the content of the error message
** **Hint**: you can use the following input types for setting date and time
+
[source,xml]
----
<input type="date" v-model="newEvent.eventDate" placeholder="YYYY-MM-DD">
<input type="time" v-model="newEvent.startTime" placeholder="HH:mm">
----

1. **Register a person to an event** (when a new event should occur in the
  list of events printed next to a person)
** Provide a selection of people
*** You need a corresponding data variable (e.g. **selectedPerson**)
*** You can use the HTML `<select v-model="selectedPerson">` tag where each
option (`<option>` tag with `v-for` Vue.js parameter) is filled dynamically from
the list of people.
*** **Hint:** You can add a first disabled option as follows:
+
[source,xml]
----
<option disabled value="">Please select one</option>
----

** Provide a selection of events in a similar way.
** Provide a button to initiate registration
** Enable the button only if both a person and an event are selected

1. In all use cases,
** Report application specific errors if the backend service fails
** Prevent to enter invalid data to backend
